This repository contains a number of bash scripts created as I learned about shell permissions and shell scripting. A brief description of each shell script will be shown next to the script name. 

0-iam_betty: A bash script that changes the user to betty when run.
1-who_am_i: A bash script that prints the name of the user
4-empty: A bash script that creates an empty file named 'hello'
5-execute: A bash script that adds execute permission to the owner of the file 'hello'
6-multiple_permissions: A bash script that adds execute permissions to the file owner and group owner and read permissions to other users of the hello file
9-John_Doe: A bash script that changes the permissions of the file hello
